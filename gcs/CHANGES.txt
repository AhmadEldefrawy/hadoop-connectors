v.Next - 2014-XX-XX

  1. When running in hadoop 0.23+ (hadoop 2+), listStatus will now throw a
     FileNotFoundException when a nont-existent path is passed in.


1.2.5 - 2014-05-08

  1. Fixed a bug where fs.gs.auth.client.file was unconditionally being
     overwritten by a default value.
  2. Enabled direct upload for directory creation to save one round-trip call.
  3. Added wiring for GoogleHadoopFileSystem.close() to call through to close()
     its underlying helper classes as well.
  4. Added a new batch mode for creating directories in parallel which requires
     manually parallelizing in the client. Speeds up nested directory creation
     and repairing large numbers of implicit directories in listStatus.
  5. Eliminated redundant API calls in listStatus, speeding it up by ~half.
  6. Fixed a bug where globStatus didn't correctly handle globs containing '?'.
  7. Implemented new version of globStatus which initially performs a flat
     listing before performing the recursive glob logic in-memory to
     dramatically speed up globs with lots of directories; the new behavior is
     default, but can disabled by setting fs.gs.glob.flatlist.enable = false.


1.2.4 - 2014-04-09

  1. The value of fs.gs.io.buffersize.write is now rounded up to 8MB if set to
     a lower value, otherwise the backend will error out on unaligned chunks.
  2. Misc refactoring to enable reuse of the resumable upload classes in other
     libraries.


1.2.3 - 2014-03-21

  1. Fixed a bug where renaming a directory could cause the file contents to get
     shuffled between files when the fully-qualified file paths have different
     lengths. Does not apply to renames on files directly, such as when using
     a glob expression inside a flat directory.
  2. Changed the behavior of batch request API calls such that they are retried
     on failure in the same manner as non-batch requests.
  3. Eliminated an unnecessary dependency on com/google/protobuf which could
     cause version-incompatibility issues with Apache Shark.


1.2.2 - 2014-02-12

  1. Fixed a bug where filenames with '+' were unreadable due to premature
     URL-decoding.
  2. Modified a check to allow fs.gs.io.buffersize.write to be a non-multiple
     of 8MB, just printing out a warning instead of check-failing.
  3. Added some debug-level logging of exceptions before throwing in cases
     where Hadoop tends to swallows the exception along with its useful info.


1.2.1 - 2014-01-23

  1. Added CHANGES.txt for release notes.
  2. Fixed a bug where accidental URI decoding make it impossible to use
     pre-escaped filenames, e.g. foo%3Abar. This is necessary for Pig to work.
  3. Fixed a bug where an IOException was thrown when trying to read a
     zero-byte file. Necessary for Pig to work.


1.2.0 - 2014-01-14

  1. Preview release of GCS connector.
